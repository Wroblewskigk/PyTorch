"""
Exercise 1: Our models are underperforming (not fitting the data well). What are
3 methods for  preventing underfitting? Write them down and explain each with a
sentence.
"""

"""
Three Methods to Prevent Underfitting:

- Increase Model Complexity
        Use a more complex model (for example, add more layers or units to a 
        neural network) so it can better capture the patterns in your data.

- Reduce Regularization
        Lower the strength of regularization techniques (like L1 or L2 penalties), 
        as too much regularization can overly restrict the model and prevent it 
        from learning important relationships.

- Add More Features or Use Feature Engineering
        Introduce additional relevant features or engineer new ones to provide 
        the model with more information, helping it learn the data's structure 
        more effectively.
